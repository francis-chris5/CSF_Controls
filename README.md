# CSF_Controls
CSF_Controls is a C++ library designed to consolidate the coding for some common components in Arduino projects. At least things I have found get used in a lot of projects and often get connected and coded the same way over and over again. Such as potentiometers (with a power-indicator LED) for input sensors, or tactile-momentary-switches and capacitive-touch sensors which wire up differently but are used in essentially the same way â€“for me typically an On/Off button for both.
