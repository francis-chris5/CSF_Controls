# CSF_Controls
CSF_Controls is a C++ library designed to consolidate the coding for some common components in Arduino projects. At least things I have found get used in a lot of projects and often get connected and coded the same way over and over again. Such as potentiometers (with a power-indicator LED) for input sensors, or tactile-momentary-switches and capacitive-touch sensors which wire up differently but are used in essentially the same way â€“for me typically an On/Off button for both with code to prevent spamming the button.


The Doxygen generated documentation pages can be found at: https://francis-chris5.github.io/CSF_Controls/html/index.html. The C++ documentation can be found under the class tabs, and the documentation for the Arduino example making use of it is found under the files tab.

A zip folder containing the library to install in your Arduino IDE, and an example making use of it can be found on this repository at CSF_Controls/CSF_Controls.
